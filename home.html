                At MR Rendering, all strategies and visions are led by CEO &amp; Co-founder Hung Nguyen. In his dual role as Vision &amp; Strategy Director, he not only oversees daily operations but also shapes the company's long-term development path, ensuring every key project reflects deep strategic thinking and a commitment to exceptional quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is the bridge between the client's vision and the artistic team's execution, transforming the most complex ideas into masterpieces of architectural visualization.

            <h3 class="section-title">From Architect to Visualization Expert</h3>
            <p>
                With <strong>10 years of seasoned experience</strong> in architectural visualization, Hung brings a rare combination of technical expertise and a designer's mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                His foundation is as an <strong>Architect</strong>, and he formerly served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant in architecture</strong>. This background gives him a unique advantage: the ability to deeply understand the "design intent" of a client from its very core. He doesn't just "render" a drawing; he "translates" the architect's vision into an emotional and compelling visual narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
                At MR Rendering, he personally <strong>manages key projects</strong> and leads the company's overall development, ensuring the final output always meets the highest standard.

            <h3 class="section-title">Strategic Thinking &amp; Long-Term Vision</h3>
            <p>
                Hung's role as Vision &amp; Strategy Director is the compass for MR Rendering's growth. He believes the success of a modern 3D studio lies not just in creating beautiful images, but in its ability to become a true <strong>strategic partner</strong> to its clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                His long-term vision is to build MR Rendering into a globally respected creative hub, a place where advanced technology, professional processes, and artistic thinking intersect to create the highest value visual solutions for the architecture and real estate industry.

            <h3 class="section-title">Beyond the Boardroom: Speed &amp; Serenity</h3>
            <p>
                Outside of work and projects, Hung's character is revealed through two seemingly opposite passions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Table Tennis:</strong> As a <strong>skilled table tennis player</strong>, he embodies the agility, speed, reflexes, and tactical thinking he applies daily to business operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Tea Culture:</strong> He has a <strong>deep love for tea culture</strong>, representing patience, subtlety, and a focus on depth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This balance between the "speed" of table tennis and the "serenity" of tea culture defines his unique leadership style: decisive and agile, yet also profound, meticulous, and steadfast in his long-term vision.
